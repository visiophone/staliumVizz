Visuals in Processing using "Massive Pixel Environment", a library for extending Processing sketches to multi-node tiled displays.

This library is developed from scratch at the TACC/ACES Visualization Lab with inspiration from Most Pixels Ever, developed by Daniel Shiffman.
In the sketch there are 8 diferent modes for visualizing the sound. (keyboard numbers 1-8 changes the mode).
